            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I was born in Nashville, Tennessee in October. I have lived most of my life here but I have visited many places. I also travel to other states, when I have time. If I don't travel then I watch movies with my friends. I also like to attend concerts and shows when I can.</p>
            <p>I joined the military at 19. Since then after I got out I started school. I also dealt with an alcohol problem. Now I'm a lot better and I still drink but very little as I can. My life has been kinda crazy. But it's getting better.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>The start of my education history is from kindergarten all the way to the 12th grade. Then after graduating from high school I went to community college, but I took a break for a year after completing one academic year. After that I transferred to another community college. But now I am attending Nashville State Community College.</p>

            <h2>Favorite quote</h2>
            <p>My favorite quote is from a game called Assassin's Creed III: <br>
                <q>I realize now that it will take time, that the road ahead is long and shrouded in darkness, it is a road which will not always take me where I wish to go and I doubt I will live to see its end, but I will travel down it nonetheless. For at my side walks hope. In the face of all that insists I turn back, I carry on.</q>

            <h1>My Professional Goals</h1>
            <p>My professional goals are to graduate and apply for a new career in programming. And to also look for a career in Nashville or in another state. Another goal would be to learn as much as I can to help me with understanding more in my other classes. After I graduate I would like to look for a career at a hospital to help with programming. Or to work at a business that develops games, applications, or are in security.</p>
